Console and Cloud Shell

Objectives

   - Get access to Google Cloud.

    -Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.

    -Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.

    -Become familiar with Cloud Shell features

Task 1: Create a bucket using the Cloud Console

gsutil mb gs://provy_buckets/

Task 2: Create a bucket using Cloud Shell

gsutil mb gs://provy_buckets2/

Task 3: Become familiar with Cloud Shell features
#Upload a file

    #Open Cloud Shell.

    #Click the three dots icon in the Cloud Shell toolbar to display further options.

    #Click Upload file. Upload any file from your local machine to the Cloud Shell VM. 

#confirm that the file was uploaded by typing this command

ls

#Copy the file into one of the buckets created earlier in the lab. Replace [MY_FILE] with the file you uploaded and [BUCKET_NAME] with one of your bucket names:

gsutil cp provyfile.txt gs://provy_buckets/

Task 4: Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell
#To list available regions, execute the following command:
gcloud compute regions list

##Select a region from the list and note the value in any text editor

-Create and verify an environment variable
#Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected in the previous step:
INFRACLASS_REGION=us-central

#Verify it with echo:
echo $INFRACLASS_REGION

-Append the environment variable to a file
#Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class:
mkdir infraclass

#Create a file called config in the infraclass directory:
touch infraclass/config

#Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file:
echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config

#Create a second environment variable for your Project ID, replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your Project ID. 
INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=12345ght

#Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file:
echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config

#Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set:
source infraclass/config
echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

#Close and re-open Cloud Shell. Then issue the echo command again

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

-Modify the bash profile and create persistence
#Edit the shell profile with the following command:
nano .profile

#Add the following line to the end of the file:
source infraclass/config

#Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.
#Close and then re-open Cloud Shell to cycle the VM.
#Use the echo command to verify that the variable is still set:
    
echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
